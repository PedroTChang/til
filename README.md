Today I learned!!!!!!

I am a bootcamp student. Actualize Bootcamp. It's great, I love.

One thing that I believe I have been lacking on my end, is a system where I can keep track of what I have been learning, so I decided to try and follow Josh Branchaud's til system. I like it. It is simple, robust, scalable, and to the point.
Here's a link to his: https://github.com/jbranchaud/til#ack
