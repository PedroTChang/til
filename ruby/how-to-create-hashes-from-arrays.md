# Hash Syntax in Ruby!

Just make sure to remember:

A key goes into a doorway which is a value.
So it's key-value pairs. (correct me if I am wrong)

In Ruby hash consists of the following: a key and a value.

If we have an
array = [ {id: 1, color: "black", sound: "weird"}, {id: 2, color: "blue", sound: "cool" } ]
The syntax for calling a value, let's say 1 in this case, would be array[0]["id"] or array[0][:id].

This is quite important so that you are able to call certain values from a hash to be used for your projects/programs/ideas/otherstuff :)
