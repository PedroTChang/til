# Git Commands You Should Know

### Main commands:

- git add --all
  - This adds all your edits to the "shopping card" that is git. It is the main command that you will be using to begin your commits.
- git commit -m "your message here"
  - The command commit that gives name to the commit your doing. Basically, it's for yourself and all hoomans that will use your code. It usually is good practice to be concise and accurate to what exactly you are doing:

### Nice to knows:

- git clone [link to the repository]
  - You should essentially be inside the folder that you want to clone the repository to!j
- git pull --no edit
